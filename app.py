 based on aesthetic, for the weather, the type of clothes, the colour combinations, the gender, and 
 any extra information but dont give extra info more priority over the other fields:
particular occasion:{occasion},

extra iinformation:{extra} ,
If either of the instruction is not present use the best of your judgement to assume it, 
use as many fashion blogs as you want to make a decision and 
give the top 10 results bulletted in seperate lines
